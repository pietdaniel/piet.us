Running the 1:1
===

2023-09-22

# Intro

This document describes how I run 1:1s, my thoughts on the process, and a guide for other managers to take inspiration from.

# Goals

The goal of the 1:1, as Camille Fournier states in [The Manager's Path](https://www.amazon.com/Manager%60s-Path-Camille-Fournier/dp/1491973897):

> 1. Create a human connection between you and your manager. (aka - Build rapport)
> 2. Provide a regular opportunity for you to speak privately with your manager about whatever needs discussing.

The 1:1 is a great way for a manager to exercise their responsibilities, such as:

- Delegating and trusting your team with important tasks
- Coaching and developing your people
- Staying technically up to date with a limited time investment
- Being willing and able to say no effectively to your team and your boss
- Getting your team to work effectively together (this does not happen on its own)

Moreover, it provides a venue to:

- Build a trusting relationship
- Stay informed and aligned
- Provide mutual feedback to help each other grow
- Address topics prone to getting lost in the shuffle (e.g., career development, )

# Guidelines

- Be on time
  - Let your direct know you value their time by action
- Change the setting
  - Go out and grab coffee, go for a walk, get a snack, go to a park
- It’s OK to cancel
  - Let the direct know that if they have nothing to talk about they are free to cancel the 1:1
  - This is their time with you, if they need it back for focus they should feel free to take it
- Keep a shared log of discussion points and action items
  - See thie Appendix for a template
- Come prepared
  - Be sure both you and your direct report are prepared for the meeting, having talking points outlined and communicated ahead of time to ensure a fluid and effective meeting
- They own the agenda… mostly
  - It's ok to request updates on OKRs or understand blockers but in general the Direct Report should drive the meeting, with their needs put first.
  - As a guideline, 90% of the talking points should be from the direct report
- Try not to accumulate feedback for the 1:1
  - Ideally, feedback should be provided immediately to direct reports. 1:1s can give you time to expand on this feedback and discuss career motivations, but prefer immediate feedback over accumulating it for the 1:1

# Talking Points
